# AIMBRACE documentation

AIMBRACE is a framework for apps built on [Cordis](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@deepseek-ai/cordis), the plugin system
ACRYL runs on. Cordis does the composing: plugins, services, dependencies, lifecycle, cleanup and events. AIMBRACE adds a
library of plugins extracted from ACRYL, and a command that copies them into your app. You own every copied line; there
is no AIMBRACE runtime to import.
