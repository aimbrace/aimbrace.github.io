# Getting started

You need Node 22.18 or newer (Node runs the TypeScript directly, with no build step) and npm. Git, to save your app.

## Create an app

From a checkout of this repository:

```sh
pnpm install && pnpm run build        # once: the aimbrace command itself
node packages/cli/bin/aimbrace.js init ../my-app --agent -y
cd ../my-app
npm install
npm run dev                           # prints its URL; the app's data lives in .aimbrace/
```

`init` never writes into a directory that is not empty. Without `--agent` you get the smaller `app` template.

| Template | Plugins | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| `app` | `instance`, `http`, `server`, `manifest`, `save` | a Cordis app that serves routes |
| `agent` | the above plus `tasks`, `agent`, `extensions`, `builder` | the same, with an offline agent that can extend the app while it runs |

Every generated app is TypeScript, has `npm test` (`node:test`) and `npm run check` (types), and depends at run time on
`@deepseek-ai/cordis` and `yaml` (plus `@deepseek-ai/schemastery` if you add `settings`).

## Try the agent

```sh
curl -X POST <url>/ask -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{"question":"create route hello /hello Hello"}'
# {"status":"completed","output":"hello: installed, active.", ...}
curl <url>/hello            # {"text":"Hello"}
curl <url>/tasks            # the run, as a durable task that owns its tool calls
```

Give it a real model (any OpenAI-compatible API) and describe what you want instead:

```sh
AIMBRACE_MODEL_URL=http://127.0.0.1:11434/v1 AIMBRACE_MODEL=qwen2.5-coder npm run dev    # or a hosted API with AIMBRACE_MODEL_KEY
curl -X POST <url>/ask -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{"question":"add a GET /time route that returns the time"}'
```

Either way the agent wrote a Cordis plugin into `extensions/hello/`, installed it into the running app, and checked that its route
answers before reporting it live. See [Extending a running app](extending-apps.md).

## Add plugins

```sh
node <aimbrace>/packages/cli/bin/aimbrace.js plugins             # the library
node <aimbrace>/packages/cli/bin/aimbrace.js add settings        # copy one into this app, with what it requires
npm install                                                       # new dependencies, if it added any
```

Then mount it: add it to the registry in `src/app.ts` and a row in `blend.yaml`. See [The plugin library](plugins.md).

## Lock and save

```sh
npm run lock                 # aimbrace.lock.json: what the app is built from, with digests
npm run save -- "add hello"  # git commit (and push, if there is a remote)
```

`save` refuses a file that looks like it holds a secret, and refuses to push an app that is not `visibility: public` to a
public remote. Nothing is committed when it refuses.

## Where things live

| Path | What |
|---|---|
| `blend.yaml` | the app as data: plugin rows, config, parameters ([manifest](manifest.md)) |
| `src/app.ts` | the registry of plugins your code provides; mounts the manifest |
| `src/routes.ts` | your own plugin |
| `src/plugins/` | plugins copied from the library; yours to edit |
| `extensions/` | plugins installed while the app runs (`agent` template); part of your app |
| `.aimbrace/` | the app's data: settings, installed-extension state, the extension ledger, task records (not committed) |

Set `AIMBRACE_HOME` to keep the data elsewhere and `AIMBRACE_PORT` to choose the first port tried (`0` for any free port).
Nothing else reads the environment.
